        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This strawberry spinach salad is a great way to get kids to eat spinach! Someone brought this salad to a potluck dinner,
         and I had to have the recipe. Since then, I've made it many times and I've been asked for the recipe every time I take it
        somewhere.</p>
